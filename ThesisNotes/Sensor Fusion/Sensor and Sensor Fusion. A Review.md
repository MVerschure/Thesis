This paper gives an overview of different sensors and sensor fusion techniques. 
### Sensor Fusion Approaches
There are three main approaches in Multi Sensory Data Fusion (MSDF): low, mid and high level fusion. Where HLF would indicate fusion at a semantic level. LLF would mean fusion at the lowest level of abstaction, i.e. raw data. A *non-linear Kalman filter* is mentioned as a way of achieving HLF.

Fuzzy seems to be a thing

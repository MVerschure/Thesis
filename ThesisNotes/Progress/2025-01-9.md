#### TODO - Today
The questions in [[2025-01-6]] are still valid.
#### Pondering #simplest-case
There are certain "expecations" that need to be modeled.
- **Continuity**: A detected object is expected to exist indefinitely. *Existence should be a random variable.* 
- **Surprisal**: In any new observation, a new objected can be detected anywhere in the FOV. Ofcourse, whether or not some space is observed, effects the prior of expecting a observation.
- **Confusion**: A set of observations, consecutive or not, may contain conflicting information.
##### Spatial VS Object representation
The world can be described as a hierarchical set of objects: there is a floor, on which stands a table, on which stands a display, on which a letter is "printed". This description does lack some spatial information: where on the table is the display located? And of course there is the implicit assumption that all space in between objects is empty. Though this results in a information dense description of the world and it's occupants, it might prove to be difficult to perform any meaningful computations in terms of generalization. 

Thus I would like to advocate a more spatial oriented world description by viewing the world representation as probability function: Were I to look here, what would I probably find? Perhaps somewhat analogous to the square of the wave-function found in quantum physics. As is being done in existing world representations, space can be discretised into voxels and than each voxel would contain a set of probabilities describing the chance to find different objects. The model would then only have to describe the evolution of this voxelized  world.

Since the object centered way of representing the world would provide a compact form, and the data is given in a similar format, functions to traverse between the two representations would be useful.

#### TODO - Today
Continue with the process described in [[2024-12-6]]. That is create the filtered on content page. 
#### Notes

What will follow are some short summaries form the final 7 papers. The focus will be on how AI is implemented, i.e. what is the role of the mean field approximation and where is the complexity of the problem located. For the complexity of the system, extra attention will be paid to how the functions of motion and sensory mapping are constructed. 

**Exploring actionâ€‘oriented models via active inference for autonomous vehicles**
Uses a hybrid Bayesian filer called the modified Markov jump particle filter, consisting of a particle and a Kalman filter. Thus this paper is useless for my literature study.

**Integration of Sense and Control for Uncertain Systems Based on Delayed Feedback Active Inference**
It describes the creation of an alternative active inference implementation that is capable of dealing with delays. A factor graph is mentioned, but state estimation is achieved using gradient descent. Effectively all the complexity is within $f(\cdot)$ and $g(\cdot)$.

**A free energy principle for the brain**
This paper is where it all started for me with active inference. Here they funnily enough increase complexity by adding hierarchy in different layers of inferencing networks.

**A Novel Adaptive Controller for Robot Manipulators Based on Active Inference**
Makes use of some clever tricks to super simplify $f(\cdot)$ and $g(\cdot)$. 

**PID control as a process of active inference with linear generative models**
Uses the gradient descent method.  $f(\cdot)$ and $g(\cdot)$ are used to describe a dynamical system.

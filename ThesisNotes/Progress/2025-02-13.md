[Yesterday](2025-02-12) I created a summery of my thoughts about working with some form of a "correlation" matrix $R$ which indicates similarity between objects already in the believe state and objects found in an observation. Today I would like to see if I can create an simple implementation of this idea.
#### The Plan
The first step is to constrain this problem and identify different, mostly uncorrelated, sub-problems. So, the problem constraints/simple problem definition:
- **2 Object in the believe, 2 objects in the observation -> Calculate update**
Then some somewhat isolated problems:
- [x]  *Calculate the KL-divergence*
- [ ] *Construct a Mixture observation related to `x1` and `x2`* 
- [ ] *Create a model*
#### The Result

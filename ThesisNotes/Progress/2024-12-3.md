#### Meeting Martijn
The depth and content of the literature study are sufficient. However works needs to be done writing the story to the point. The point of the story can be to show why the application of the mean-field approximation as is being done in the active inference framework is inneficient (high dimensional minimization is useless?) and misses the power of graphical models. All the complexity is contained in $f(\cdot)$ and $g(\cdot)$, the functions of motion and sensory mapping. Correct usage of graphical models allows for the message passing method, which though possibly more computationally expensive, allows much more intuitive creation of generative models. 
#### ToDo - How to Continue
- [ ] Check on more implementations of active inference and see how the functions $f(\cdot)$ and $g(\cdot)$ are constructed. This could be structured literature research.
- [ ] Start with writing an abstract. This will help to improve clarity of what structure the report should have. 
	- [ ] The report should follow a structure which convinces the reader of my point. It should probably start with why active inference (observations as functions of actions), fundametals: Bayesian inference and a more elaborate construction of the active inference framework. Then the message passing method should be introduced, etc.

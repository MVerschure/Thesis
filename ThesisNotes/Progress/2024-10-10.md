Started to read for different partition assumptions like the *mean-field* approximations. Found the term #believe-propogation (BP) that might indicate a wider field of research. #factor-graphs seems to be an other term that is coined often in relation to discrete state space #active-inference

- Main question in the first sentence of the last paragraph of the introduction
- Start every chapter with an introduction on how the chapter contributes to answering the main question
- The report should read backwards, where the answer of the main question should be at the bottom, and scrolling to the top you should find out why this is the answer
- For now focus on different assumptions made on the approximate posterior distribution ($Q$)

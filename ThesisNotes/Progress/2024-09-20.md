#### Problem
I searched for the question selected in [[2024-09-19]], the answer is almost trivial. It can be found in a paper with the title "*Variational free energy and the Laplace approximation*" in the section "*Laplace approximation*". This is most likely not enough to be a complete literature study
#### TODO - today
- [x] Read Koen's literature study to get a feel of what I need to work towards.
- [x] Formulate a new question. 
- [x] Find literture for the new question
#### Results
**New Question:** How does #active-inference handle discrete variables, specifically the categorical dist.

I label new good literature with *Main Sources* in Zotero.
#### TODO - [[2024-09-23]]
 - [ ] Create the introduction
 - [ ] Think about a chapter layout
 - [ ] Begin writing the chapters

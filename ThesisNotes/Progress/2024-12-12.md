	- [x] Motivate intrest in AIF
	- [x] Elborate structrure of the paper
- [x] Active Inference
	- [x] Briefly explain the goal of AIF if this is not yet in the introduction.

	- [x] Practical evaluation of free energy
		- [x] Mean field and Laplace assumptio
		- [x] Structured Literature study
- [x] Vartiational Bayesian Inference
	- [x] Reuse equations from the AIF section
	- [x] Make it clear that Bayesian inference is a large field of study
	- [x] Make it clear why I only discuss variational methods and not sample based.
- [x] Message passing
	- [x] Check whether section introduction still make sense.
	- [x] Remotive example
- [x] Revisiting Active Inference
	- [x] Placing the mean-field approx in context of graphical models
	- [x] Gradient descent vs message passing.
- [x] Conclusion
	- [x] Just ff-ing write it :)
- [x] Structure references

#### Update
Today I did nothing. So now I'm going to summarize the progress of the last few days. I manged to use the RxInfer package to perform inference in a variety of setting. Though basically only 2: an offline hmm and a online hmm. The most basic form of the final model I have currently implemented is a hmm with 2 states: an object either exists, or it doesn't.

The question now is: **How to continue?** What is the next level of complexity I can add to the system? I would say that it is a single object with questionable existence and position.

#### What Have I Got
So far I have been working on getting a feel for RxInfer and managed to implement some simple models. The models I have got are the following:
- **0D-HMM**
	- This model has two variables $s$ and $y$ representing a one-hot encoded state and observation vector respectively. Where $s_{i+1} = As_i$ and $y_i = Bs_i$. This particular case only 2 states and can be taken to represent the existance, or lack thereof, of an object. ![[hidden_markov_model.png]]
- **0D-Online**
	- This model should be practically be identical to **0D-HMM** but with the implementation of streamlined, i.e. online, interference. A online model requires a slightly different model definition, simultaneously more intuitive and confusing :)![[0D-online.png]]
- **1D-Static** 
	- Compared to previously discussed methods it drops the inference about whether an object exists or not, but focuses on inferring the position of a single, assumed to be existing and non-dynamic object. The static in the name implies that all data to be inferred over is known *a priory*.![[1D-Static.png]]
- **1D-Online**
	- An online version of the **1D-Static** model. For fun I change the location of the "object" half way through the observations (from red to green). This results into some interesting behavior. The model doesn't contain any dynamics, which is likely the cause cause of this. 
	- ![[one_dim_model.gif]]
	 The resulting free energy might be of interest here. The sudden jump corresponds to where the location is changed. ![[1D-Online-free-energy.png]]
#### What is Next?
What is next is to merge these two cases aswell as how to figure out how to deal with "missing" observations. Though the solution to the latter might be the challenge in implementing the former.

So how would I merge the two?

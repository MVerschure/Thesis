### Preperation
**Goal Literature:** Compare #sensor-fusion methods to #active-inference to merge the two
**Current Belief:** The #Kalman-filter is very similar and the trick used for #sensor-fusion can be used in #active-inference as well.
**Open Questions:**
- Precision of #active-inference believe-state
- How to handle discrete variables within #active-inference 
### Discussed
The literature study is not the time to gather information for the Thesis. It needs to be a *simple* question and answer approach. We identified 3 question I could focus on:
- Precision of #active-inference believe state
- How to handle discrete variables within #active-inference 
- How to achieve object-based/semantic #sensor-fusion 
I indicated I would be most interested in searching for the awnser on the first question.

#### TODO
Today I have a meeting planned with Matijn, so I should prepare some questions. I would also like to dive into some complex implementations which use RxInfer. The list in [[2025-01-6]] will be used as a guide.
#### Thoughts
- How would I be able to achieve online inference?
- What would be the simplest inference model I could come up with?

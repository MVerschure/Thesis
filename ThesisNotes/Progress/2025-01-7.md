#### TODO
Today I have a meeting planned with Matijn, so I should prepare some questions. I would also like to dive into some complex implementations which use RxInfer. The list in [[2025-01-6]] will be used as a guide.
#### Thoughts
- How would I be able to achieve online inference?
- What would be the simplest inference model I could come up with?

#simplest-case Beginnen met simpleste setting -> 2 frame bounding boxes. Dus werken met de Mirte is nog niet gelijk nodig.
#### Implementation ( #simplest-case) 
So the idea is to create the simplest case possible of the sensor fusion project I'm trying to accomplisch using bayesian inference. This would be to generate 2 data points, each representing the state of a single object and some odometry data, and propose a model which is capable of generating the probability that the object in the two data points are the same, given the odometry data. Lets assume a stationary object 1m in front of the robot. The robot does not change in x,y position, but does rotate 10 degrees counter clockwise. A global coordinate frame is chosen such that the robot starts at (0,0) and the object at (1,0).

Might be good to note that Cartesian coordinates are not a natural set of coordinates to work in for human. Polar coordinates might prove to be a more natural way of dealing with stuff.

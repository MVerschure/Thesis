#### Meeting Martijn
*Friston T maze* - A motivational example by Martijn that simple models are enough to graduate.

More over, we spoke about the literature study. I explained my mistake. 

Then we had a small section on practical implementations of the model and world representations. In line with the example, start with the #simplest-case . As to world representations, just like in [[2025-01-9]] two options were discussed: spatial or object centered. Martijn mentioned his implementation used both. 
#### #simplest-case 
I figured the simplest case is even simpler than I assumed. It is a 0-dimensional (0 spatial dimensions that is) in which an object either exists or not.

#### State of Affairs
I am beginning to see a more complete overview of inference on Bayesian networks. There are 2 main approaches: exact variational methods, like believe propagation (i.e. message passing). Or approximate variational methods, which include the introduction of an approximate probability distribution and the minimization of the KL-divergence. 
#### TODO - Today
- [x] Read up on the exact variational methods
- [ ] How does the Bethe approximation relate to message passing?
- [ ] Think about how to integrate them
- [ ] Start a search for practical implementations of exact variational methods
- [ ] Start a search for practical implementations of approximate variational methods.
#### Results

#### TODO - Tomorrow
- [ ] ...
